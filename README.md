# Vector-and-Shape-Utillities-in-Cpp

Creation of a vector - Vec2 (2d vector), not to be confused with the std::vector container, Vec2 is instead a geometric vector. Class structure is simple with just 
two member variables - x and y, but with an extensive number of help functions including some vector math etc. It is upon this framework all other shape classes are based.
